📊 Customer Behavior & Segmentation Analysis

SQL | Python (Pandas) | Power BI

Business Problem
A retail business wanted to understand who drives revenue, what influences spending, and how subscriptions and loyalty impact profitability.

Dataset

3,300+ purchase records

3,900+ customers

18 columns (demographics, spend, discounts, subscriptions, shipping, ratings)

Raw dataset with missing values → cleaned and validated

Approach

Used SQL (joins, aggregations, window functions) to transform raw transactions into customer-level metrics

Validated data quality and metrics using Python (Pandas)

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs and segments

Key Insights

Subscribed customers (27%) contribute ~68% of total revenue

Subscribers spend ~45% more per order than non-subscribers

Express shipping customers spend ~12% more than standard shipping

Repeat buyers show a 78% loyalty rate, indicating strong retention potential

Discounts do not reduce order value and are used by high-spending customers

Business Impact

Identified subscriptions as the strongest revenue lever

Highlighted retention as a higher ROI strategy than acquisition

Provided data-driven inputs for loyalty programs, shipping upsells, and promotions

Deliverables

Power BI dashboard with filters (subscription, category, shipping, gender)

SQL queries for segmentation and KPI calculation
